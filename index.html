universe of his life.

         <p align="justify" id="para">
Suvidya College is the realization of a long cherished dream that has the history of more than a century. The establishment of Suvidya College in 1984 was the fulfilment of that long cherished dream. During its existence in India since 1845, the Congregation of the Missionaries of St Francis de Sales have been making series of efforts to create facilities for its young members to receive adequate religious formation that is fully Christian as well as Indian.
The steady growth of the MSFS in India called for a formation Institute of its own. The efforts of our fathers bore fruit and thus Suvidya College in Bangalore was started as a Philosophate in 1984. Very  Rev.Fr. Emile Mayoraz, the Superior General of the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales, through his letter dated 21 January 1992 declared Suvidya College a common concern of the entire congregation. The task of the working the modalities of Suvidya Collegeâ€™s administration as well as a consensus program was thereby entrusted with the Indian Provincials.
The Congregation for Catholic Education through its letter dated 24th January, 1996, with the Decree No. 1435/95/4 granted Suvidya College the Affiliation to the Faculty of Philosophy of Pontifical University of Urabaniana, Rome.  But presently  Suvidya College for its B.Ph./ B.A. programme in Philosophy is affiliated to De Sales University, Center Valley, PA, USA, through a memorandum of understanding signed on 11th of February 2008. Besides catering to the needs of the various MSFS Provinces in India for which it is primarily meant, the College receives students from several other religious congregations, some of which have opened their Study houses in the neighbourhood of Suvidya College with the aim of initiating the students into a genuine intellectual culture through a sound philosophical formation and Suvidya College draws out its curriculum.
